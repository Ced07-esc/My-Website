<h1>Campus History</h1>
  <p>HOPE sprung in every heart in Ballesteros with the realization of a long-time dream - the opening of the only public high school in town, the Ballesteros National High School.</p>
  <p>
    FAITH made this collective dream come true as the people gave their full trust to their leaders then, notably the former Cagayan District II Representative Leoncio M. Puzon and Mayor Gabino R. Collado who jointly pushed for the creation of this public high school for the youth of Ballesteros who could not afford to go to the more expensive private high schools.
  </p>
  <p>LOVE to the people and to education inspired these officials into pursuing Republic Act 6055 in congress, an act seeking to establish Ballesteros National High School as an annex of Abulug National Rural and Vocational High School of Abulug Cagayan.
  </p>
  <p>In its official opening in June 1988. Enrollees and their parents flocked to the school which was then stationed at a borrowed building at the Ballesteros Central School. However, with just five pioneer teachers and a two-classroom building, some of the enrollees had to be channeled to the two private high schools under the Educational Service Contracting Scheme of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports. Under this scheme the secondary education of the students who enrolled in public high school but could not be actually accommodated is subsidized by the DECS. Such students finish their secondary education in private schools without paying tuition fees.</p>
  <p>From 1988, ANRVHS Principal Mr. Ernesto L. Esteban through head teacher Ms. Lourdes J. Ave managed and supervised the school with the five pioneer teachers namely: Mrs. Evangeline C. Collado, Mrs. Maryrose G. Espergal, Mr. David C. Lorenzo, Mrs. Yolanda U. Sosa and Mrs. Blandina Corazon T. Unite.</p>
  <p>Not long after, though R.A. 7087 of 1991 granted the school its independent status. Thus, the BHS-ANRVHS Annex came to be known as Ballesteros National High School-a school that soon emerged as a center of excellence in education in this part of the country.</p>
  <p>Upon the retirement of the head teacher in 1990, Mrs. Evangeline C. Collado took the reins as school administrator, first as a teacher in-charge until eventually she became Secondary Principal III with the unprecedented growth of the school.</p>
  <p>BNHS finally moved to its permanent home in nearby Sta. Cruz in 1991 with the construction of its first building. This one hectare duly titled lot was donated by the late Vice Mayor Mr. Auvifer L. Ruelos, the school site was expanded with the donation of another one half hectare adjacent lot by the late Mrs. Angustia Agustin, a civic-spirited Ballesterian based in California, USA.</p>
  <p>The school proved to be a blessing to the whole of Ballesteros. First, it answered the parents’ financial woes. Second, it became an avenue of cooperative partnership among parents, teachers, the community and the local government unit whose one goal is to develop the people in order to develop the town. And finally, it became a showcase of Ballesteros culture and excellence.</p>
  <p>The principal awarded as Outstanding Principal of Cagayan in 1995, instituted educational mechanisms to make the school relevant to the community and to the changing needs of the time while making its students achieve honors up to the national level and also in the international level.</p>
  <p>The students and graduates now mirror the school’s mission and vision of producing academically brilliant young men and women who become productive and competent citizens and who dedicate their lives to the Supreme Being to the country and to the global community.</p>
