<h1>Campus History</h1>
    <p>The Libertad Barrio High School was founded in the year 1967 by virtue of the Republic Act No.6054, otherwise known as the Barrio High School Charter through the joint efforts of the PTCA Officials, barrio officials headed by the Bo.Captain Rodrigo Asejo, Community Leaders and Miss Felina Guimmayen, now Dr. Felina G. Castillejos, who was then the School Administrator of Libertad Elementary School.  
    </p>
    <p>A temporary building was constructed in its present site but when it was blown by a strong typhoon classes were moved to the Libertad Elementary School thus occupying some rooms for some years. Miss Felina S. Guimmayen was then the First School Head. The Enrolment was first year-52 and the second year-32. There were two (2) full time teachers and one (1) part time teacher. In 1968-1969, Mr. Eladio Miranda was the school head. There were 51 first year, 48 second year, and 31 third year. There were 3 full time teachers and 1 part time teacher. In 1969-1970, Mr. Eladio Miranda was still the school head. In 1970-1971, Mr. Pedro Agaceta was the School Head with 3 full time and 4 part time teachers. Mr. Pedro Agaceta continued to be the School Head up to 1977 with 6 full time teachers and 2 part time teachers. In 1977 to 1980, Miss Priscilla Fernandez was the School Head with 8 full time teachers. In 1980 to 1982 Mr. Wilfredo Agustin was the Principal with 9 full time teachers. In 1982-1983 Miss Paz F. Tagoc was assigned as OIC. From year to year enrolment increased thus in 1983-1984 the school was moved to its present site and Miss Paz F. Tagoc was the School Head.</p>
    <p>
        The Libertad Barrio High School was nationalized and was then named as Libertad National High school by virtue of the Presidential Procalamation No. 699 July 9, 1989.
    </p>
    <p>
        School years 1987 to 1988 registered a record of high enrolment that necessitated for more number of teachers. From 1987 to 1988, the teaching staff has increased from 10 full time teachers to 23 teachers. Miss Paz F. Tagoc continued to be the school head until she retired in January, 2001. After the retirement of Miss Paz F. Tagoc, the LNHS was headed by the assigned Officer Incharge Mr. Abraham C. Acosta, a Teacher I who was later promoted to Head Teacher III on December 2002. Mr. Acosta remained to be the Officer Incharge up to March 2003. March 3, 2003, Dr. Priscilla T. Pacis was appointed Principal of Libertad National High School.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now the beautiful Libertad National High School with 24 teachers headed by Dr. Priscilla T. Pacis, Secondary School Principal III is catering to the needs of 859 students who came from different barangays of Abulug, Pamplona and Luna, Kalinga Apayao
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the able leadership of Dr. Priscilla T. Pacis and with support of the PTA, SGC, LGU and Local School Board, the school is slowly but firmly working on the fulfillment of its Vision-Mission.
